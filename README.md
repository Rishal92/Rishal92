Hey! I’m Rishal 👋
Full stack dev, coffee addict ☕, and part-time bug whisperer 🐛➡️✨.
I build apps, break stuff (for science), fix them again.
I’m big on clean code, dark mode, smart teams, and sharing what I learn (usually the hard way).
If it compiles, we celebrate. If it doesn’t… more coffee.

- 🔭 I’m **currently working on** coding more for fun and sharing that on GitHub.
- 🌱 I’m **currently learning** how to enjoy coding as a hobby dispite it being my day job.
- 👯 I’m looking to **collaborate** on PWA's or Web API's.
- 🤔 I’m **looking for help with** finding tiny cool ideas to learn advance coding concepts.
- 💬 **Ask me about** building high performing agile teams.
- 📫 How to **reach me**: Twitter [@RishalCodes](https://twitter.com/RishalCodes?lang=en)
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: I enjoy minecraft.
